# iCalculator_release

**This is a function graph calculator**

## How to use

- You need to give each function a specific name like f, g.
- Basic functions are supported.
- '\*' represent multiply and can not be omitted.

## Input examples

- f(x)=e^x

- g(x)=x^2+1

- h(x)=sin(pi*x)

## Bugs not fixed

1. The graph goes wrong at some infinite discontinuous points.
2. Only integers and fractions are supported, decimals are not supported yet.
